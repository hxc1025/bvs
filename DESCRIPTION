Description: Efficient algorithms for variable selection in the context of Bayesian linear and generalized linear regression models. The spike-and-slab prior which consists of the normal distribution and a point mass components is used for variable selection. Variational Bayesian algorithm is used to obtain the approximate posterior distribution.
